<h3>Glaciers of the Rhone â€“ Souvorov's road - Devil's bridge</h3><br />

From Montreux we shall cross the whole canton Valais, its valleys, vineyards and apricot 
trees gardens. We will go along the river Rhone up to its beginning, a glacier, which you 
will be able to visit from the inside.

Then we will continue across the Furka pass (2400 meters high). There we will meet the Souvorov's 
road through the Alps. You will see the Devil's bridge, learn history of its builder, judge tactical 
art of A.V.Souvorov and admire heroism of the russian soldats who fought there for the bridge in 1799. 
Near from the bridge stands a 12-meters-high cross cut in the cliff, in the memory of the ones who died.
<br />

To go back we will stop in Andermatt (typical swiss upper mountain-village), use a train that goes through 
the mountain, on which we will put the car up to Oberwald. From there we will continue to Montreux 
by car to conclude the excursion.
